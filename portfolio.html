                    During my CIS 4301 course, Information and Database Systems 1, I was placed in a team of 4 computer
                    science students and we were given several tasks to complete. We had to download a database of at
                    least 100,000 tuples, upload the data to the UF Oracle network through SQL Developer, and then
                    create an interactive webpage that is linked to the database and can run queries to retrieve
                    information for a user. The process also included much careful planning of how the website would
                    look, preparing conceptual and logical models for our data before generating the tables used to
                    store it, and much research into how to actually open and close a database connection from our
                    website to the database.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:13px;margin-left:12px;">
                    The languages that we used to create the website were HTML and CSS, with Bootstrap being relied
                    upon to add some of the embellishment. SQL was required to actually query the data and retrieve
                    information to a user when they needed it. PHP was the language that we settled on to establish
                    the database connection and run the SQL queries. The link above: 'Database System Webpage', will
                    take you to our website so that you can interact with our database and judge our body of work for
                    yourself.

                    <p style="font-size:13px;margin-left:12px;">
                        This project was begun in the Summer of 2014 on my own volition. It is a text-based, dungeon-
                        delving adventure game that I developed using Java so that I could master the language, use as
                        many concepts as I could think of, and implement some mechanisms which were new to me at the time
                        (i.e. a sorting algorithm for the inventory). The video game uses various advanced concepts in
                        object-oriented programming such as inheritance, polymorphism, hash maps, a turn-based battle
                        system, and a great deal of creativity and imagination from my part when it came to generating
                        new weapons, armor types, and even magical spells.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size:13px;margin-left:12px;">
                        The project initially took me two full weeks to complete. I spent about 8 hour days working
                        diligently to get the project done as best as I could, with little to no code duplication,
                        many comments, and plenty of positive programming practices. Although it was not bug-free at
                        the time of completion, I have occasionally played the game and fixed what I hope to be nearly
                        all of the bugs. Although I do not have an executable .jar file for the user to actually see the
                        game, I did provide the link to the github repository containing the code so that you can my
                        code and programming practices when I was beginning my own adventure into computer science.
